If you already know how to install forge you can ignore this.

**DO NOT PUT THE FORGE JAR FILE IN YOUR MODS FOLDER!**

Run the jar file and press Install client. Wait for it to complete the installation, then restart your Minecraft launcher and select the forge 1.16.5 version.

IF THE JAR FILE DOESN'T RUN -- you probably need to install Java
IF FORGE DOESN'T INSTALL -- a popup likely came up already explaining this, but just incase you're dumb dumb idoit, you need to run a vanilla version of 1.16.5 before installing forge.
